Experiment in Github Repo Poetry

Ode to a Repo:
Repo,
Repo,
This is
a Repo...

Let's commit to this
Repo!

Repo!
Repo!
REPO!
So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body"
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body"
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
